            Members are expected to attend two one-hour meetings each week. After teams are formed each semester, we find common times that work for everyone. We also suggest an additional weekly small-group meeting for more project work.

            Projects vary each semester based on member interests. Past projects include web apps, mobile apps, and data analysis tools. The focus is on learning and building a portfolio. We always say what you put in is what you get out — we’ve even had startups and full-on research projects spin up from this program.

After that, you’ll select who you’d like to work with. We’ll do our best to accommodate everyone and form balanced groups based on frontend and backend interests.
