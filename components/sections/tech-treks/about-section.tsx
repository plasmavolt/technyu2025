          Initially created to expose freshmen to the tech industry, we realized there were sophomores and juniors just as new to the field. Tech Treks now has two participant types: members and tutors!
        </p>
        <p>
          Members: You will be part of a 12–15 person semesterly cohort that meets twice a week. You’ll work with a small group of 3–4 peers to build a full-stack project for your portfolio over the course of the semester. The program also includes social events, weekly workshops on specific topics, access to leads and tutors with industry experience, and office tours throughout the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tutors: You will aid members in building their projects by offering your expertise during one of our two weekly meetings. In return, you’ll get all the same perks that regular members receive!
