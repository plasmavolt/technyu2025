They span various roles including software engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, and founders with 3-15+ years of experience. If you are keen on supporting this initative send us an email at hello@techatnyu.org with the subject line 'Mentorship Volunteer'."

        question: "How long does the mentorship program last?",
        answer: "Our mentorship program typically runs for one semester (about 4 months). This gives you enough time to build a meaningful relationship with your mentor and work towards your goals. Some mentorships may continue beyond the formal program if both parties agree."
    },
    {
        question: "How are mentors and mentees matched?",
        answer: "We use a careful matching process based on your goals, interests, background, and career aspirations. After you submit your application, our mentorship leads will interview you to better understand your needs. We then match you with a mentor who has relevant experience and can best support your journey."
    },
    {
        question: "How often do I meet with my mentor?",
        answer: "Most mentor-mentee pairs meet for 1 hour every 2 weeks, but the frequency and format are flexible based on both schedules. Some prefer weekly 30-minute calls, while others do monthly longer sessions. We encourage consistent communication and setting expectations early."
    },
    {
        question: "What can I work on with my mentor?",
        answer: "The mentorship is tailored to your goals! Common focuses include: technical skill development, career guidance and job search strategy, resume and LinkedIn optimization, interview preparation (technical and behavioral), side project guidance, startup advice, and general professional development."
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a cost to participate?",
